    </header>

    <div>
      <p>I'm an ex-banker, musician, humanist, food blogger and soon to be web developer, who just started learning to build and design webpages. I am passionate about sharing my experience and knowledge with others, especially young adults to become more capable and productive.</p>

    <div>
      <p>I record what I learn everyday on my personal blog, and my ultimate goal is to aid anybody who's willing to learn JavaScript from scratch to start at once and continue. Because I took more than a year to start, and kept questioning myself whether I should continue to learn JavaScript. But there's no way to answer that question if I stop now, right?</p>
